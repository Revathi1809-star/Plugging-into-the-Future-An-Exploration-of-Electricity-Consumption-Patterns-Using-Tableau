# Plugging-into-the-Future-An-Exploration-of-Electricity-Consumption-Patterns-Using-Tableau

📊 Plugging into the Future is a data analytics and visualization project that examines electricity consumption patterns across Indian states for the years 2019–2020 using Tableau.

📁 The project utilizes structured electricity consumption data to perform data preprocessing, trend analysis, and interactive visualization.

📈 It analyzes year-wise and month-wise electricity usage to identify consumption trends, seasonal variations, and demand fluctuations.

🌍 Interactive dashboards provide region-wise and state-wise insights, helping users understand electricity distribution across different parts of India.

🔎 Top and bottom electricity-consuming states are identified through comparative visual analysis, enabling performance evaluation.

📅 Month-wise analysis helps in understanding temporal changes and seasonal electricity demand patterns.

📉 Year-wise comparison highlights variations in electricity consumption between 2019 and 2020, helping identify demand trends.

🗺 Geographic map visualization presents state-wise electricity consumption using intuitive color-coded representation.

🎛 Dynamic filters enable users to interactively explore data based on State, Region, and Year for deeper analysis.

📖 A Tableau Story presents insights in a structured narrative format, improving interpretability and decision-making.

🌐 The project is deployed using Flask, where the Tableau dashboard is embedded into a web interface for easy access and presentation.

🚀 This project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics, visualization, and web deployment techniques to support energy consumption analysis and data-driven decision-making.
